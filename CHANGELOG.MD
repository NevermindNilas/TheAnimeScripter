- Fixed an issues with span-directml where it would point to a different host.

#### Regressions
- Temporarely reverted back to pytorch 2.2.2 and cuda 12.1 until .dll issues are fixed, this may result in slight performance losses.

#### Removals
- Updater.exe

### Adobe Edition

#### New
- TAS will now dynamically switch between "Full" or "Lite" mode depending on your available GPU.

#### Improved
- Improved Error handling.
- The terminal ( command prompt ) will now start minimized in order to not disrupt your workflow.
- Immense improvements on output handling, TAS will now selectively create and choose specific types of folders based on your current process. This also comes with nice text formatting for the output with keywords like "_DE" for Deduplication and "_SH" for Sharpen.
- Better download functionality with a possibility in increased max download speed.

#### Bug Fixes
- For some users the download would often hang, this should now have been remedied or at least improved and TAS should now attempt to reconnect in case of a error connection.

- A complete overhaul on how model downloading works, it is recommended to go to Appdata\Roaming\TheAnimeScripter\Weights and deleting the whole folder with this version
- Released before 1.9.1 but wasn't announced, TAS now has nightly builds at: https://github.com/NevermindNilas/TAS-Nightly
- Upgraded SPAN Models to `2x_Spanimation V1.5` - Special thanks to @TNTWise for the models.

#### Improvements
- Up to 25% faster Rife TensorRT Inference performance.
- Better TensorRT Engine Handling in case if the engine / driver is outdated.
- Depth Maps should now produce significantly better outputs compared to previous releases at a roughly 5x deduction in performance.
- Made sure the output is now always clamped
- `--ofline` can now be dynamically selected to download a specific model or list of models based on user selection. Use keyword `all` to download all of the available models.
- The number of models have been drastically cut 
- TensorRT Engine workflow should now be drastically more robust than previously with better edge case handling.
- Revised documentation in Parameters.md
- Through a few 'optimizations' in model downloads, the total weights folder should be ~1.5GB lower.
- NCNN Upscaling models should now be dynamically downloaded based on user request
- Marginal performance boosts for Upscale NCNN

- Added new Models and Encoders to the UI.
- Improved the performance and reduced some jankyness from the backend.
