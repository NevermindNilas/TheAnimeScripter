System Requirements:

Minimum:
    - OS: Windows 10/11
    - CPU: Quad-Core
    - RAM: 16 GB
    - GPU: Supports DirectX 12 and Vulkan
    - Disk Space: ~12 GB

Recommended:
    - OS: Windows 10/11, fully updated
    - CPU: Octa-Core
    - RAM: 32 GB
    - GPU: NVidia 3000 Series / AMD 6000 Series or better
    - Disk Space: ~12 GB

Recommended GPUs:
    - NCNN / DirectML: Compatible with all Vulkan / DirectX 12 capable GPUs.
    - CUDA: Requires NVIDIA 1000+ series.
    - TensorRT: Requires NVIDIA RTX 2000+ series GPUs.

Important Notes:
    - Building TensorRT Engines is a one-time process that may take a few minutes but significantly boosts performance.
    - For AMD / Intel GPU users: Opt for NCNN or DirectML versions to achieve the best performance.
    - The Rife Ensemble feature enhances results at a slight performance cost. Enable it if the trade-off is acceptable.
    - Resize multiplier supports fractional values (e.g., 0.5 for downscaling from 3840x2160 to 1920x1080).
    - Upscalers only include 2x models.
    - Denoising is resource-intensive and performs best on high-end GPUs, such as NVidia 3090/4080.
