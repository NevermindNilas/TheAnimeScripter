## üöÄ Key Features

1. **Interpolation**: Boost your video framerate through frame interpolation.
2. **Upscaling**: Enhance the resolution of your videos for an improved viewing experience.
3. **Deduplication**: Optimize your video size by removing duplicate frames.
4. **Segmentation**: Separate the background from the foreground for easier and faster rotobrushing.
5. **Auto Clip Cutting**: Increase your productivity by automatically cutting your clips using a Scene Change Filter.
6. **Integration with After Effects**: Seamlessly use our tool directly inside of After Effects.
7. **Model Chaining in After Effects**: Run Deduplication, Upscaling, Interpolation all in one.
8. **No Frame Extraction**: The script does 0 frame extraction, everything is being done in memory without additional decode and encode cycles.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

#### How to download

- Download one of the latest releases from [here](https://github.com/NevermindNilas/TheAnimeScripter/releases)

#### Or Manually build

- **Notation needed, the code in the repository can include unexpected bugs, if you want stable builds then download from the releases page, but if you want the cutting edge builds, then follow along.**

- Download and install Python 3.11 from: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/ whilst making sure to add it to System Path

- Open a terminal inside the folder

- run: ```python build.py```

#### How to use inside of After Effects

- On the top left corner open File -> Scripts -> Install ScriptUI Panel -> (Look for the TheAnimeScripter.jsx file found in folder )

- After Instalation you will be prompted with a restart of After Effects, do it.

- Now that you've reopened After Effects, go to Window -> And at the bottom of you should have a TheAnimeScripter.jsx, click it -> Dock the panel wherever you please.

## üìà Benchmarks

The following benchmarks were conducted on a system with a 13700k and 3090 GPU for 1920x1080p inputs and take x264 encoding into account:

With FP16 on for every test except NCNN.
- **Interpolation**: 
    - Rife ( v4.13 ): ~91 FPS ( Fastmode True, Essemble False )
    - Rife NCNN: N/A

- **Upscaling 2x**: 
    - Shufflecugan: ~20 FPS
    - Compact: ~19 FPS
    - UltraCompact: ~23 FPS
    - SuperUltraCompact: ~27 FPS
    - SwinIR: ~1.5 FPS
    - Cugan: N/A
    - Cugan-NCNN: ~7 FPS

- **Depth Map Generation**:
    - DPT-Hybrid: ~17 FPS
    - DPT-Large: N/A

- **Segmentation**:
    - Isnet-Anime: ~10 FPS ( with BF16 / AMP Autocast )

Please note that these benchmarks are approximate and actual performance may vary based on specific video content, settings, and other factors.
