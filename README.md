# TheAnimeScripter

Welcome to TheAnimeScripter, a comprehensive tool designed for both video processing enthusiasts and professionals all within After Effects. Our tool offers a wide array of functionalities, including interpolation, upscaling, deduplication, segmentation, and more.

## üöÄ Key Features

1. **Interpolation**: Boost your video framerate through frame interpolation.
2. **Upscaling**: Enhance the resolution of your videos for an improved viewing experience.
3. **Deduplication**: Optimize your video size by removing duplicate frames.
4. **Segmentation**: Separate the background from the foreground for easier and faster rotobrushing.
5. **Integration with After Effects**: Seamlessly use our tool directly inside of After Effects.
6. **Model Chaining in After Effects**: Run Deduplication, Upscaling, Interpolation all in one.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### Automated Installation

If Python 3.10 - 3.11 isn't installed on your system, run this file:

- run ```setup.bat``` ( as admin ) 

if it is installed run:

- ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

- ```get_ffmpeg.bat```

#### Manual installation

- Download and install Python 3.11 from: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/ whilst making sure to add it to System Path

- Open a terminal inside the folder

- ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Download FFMPEG from: https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases

- inside the folder src make a folder named ffmpeg and drop ffmpeg.exe into it

#### How to use inside of After Effects

- On the top left corner open File -> Scripts -> Install ScriptUI Panel -> (Look for the TheAnimeScripter.jsx file found in folder )

- After Instalation you will be prompted with a restart of After Effects, do it.

- Now that you've reopened After Effects, go to Window -> And at the bottom of you should have a TheAnimeScripter.jsx, click it -> Dock the panel wherever you please.

- In the panel, set output to wherever you please and main.py to the main.py file found in the AnimeScripter directory

- N/A

## üìã To-Do

In no particular order:
- Provide a bundled version with all of the dependencies included ( need assitance with this )
- Add Rife NCNN Vulkan ( probably through ncnn api or directml )
- Add testing. ( high priority )
- Add Rife Multithreadding ( halfway done )
- ADd DepthMap process ( high priority )
- Add Pytorch segmentation. ( current models are all onnx, I will look into a pytorch conversion using onnx2torch )
- Maybe add TRT. ( probably not )

## ‚úÖ Done

- [Massive] Added Rife interpolation
- [Massive] Added Cugan Upscaling.
- [Massive] Added Cugan Multithreading.
- Added Frame deduplication.
- [Massive] Added Shuffle Cugan - 50% faster for the same quality.
- Removed unnecessary implementations like frame-by-frame output.
- Fixed rife output issues.
- Increased performance for Rife ever so slightly.
- Placed Output in the same folder as input.
- Fixed requirements.txt issue where it wouldn't download torch compiled with CUDA.
- kind-model now defaults to shufflecugan.
- Fixed issue when input path has spaces.
- Added scripts to make it easier to get things going.
- [Massive] Added SwinIR.
- [Massive] Added Compact
- [Massive] Added FFMPEG Encoding using moviepy.
- [Massive] Added Ultracompact.
- [Massive] Improved the speed of Inference by upwards of 50% from personal testing!
- Fixed issue where the last nt frames wouldn't be processed.
- [Massive] Added Segmentation.
- Added download_models.py for offline processing.
- [Massive] Added alpha testing of the After Effects script.
- Fixed Path issues associated with spaces inside the script.
- Introduced lazy loading for faster start-up times, more work needed.
- [Massive] Fixed the encoder, now it should be much higher resolution for less space.
- The output will now default to .m4v to comply with After Effects' codec support.
- [Massive] After Effects will now only upscale the trimmed part, not the whole clip.
- [Massive] Increased Rife performance by 50% and bumped up the version to 4.13.
- [Massive] Added Model chaining in the script, now multiple models can be ran at once.
- [Massive] New and Improved UI within After Effects.
- About 20x faster FFMPEG download.
- [Massive] Better start-up times and overall processing times.
- [Massive] Upscaling and Interpolating now requires only 1 decode and encode cycle meaning faster processing times.
- Fixed CPU Inference
